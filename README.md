Abstract

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a task which aims to identify the meaning of a word given its context. This problem has been investigated and analyzed in depth in English. 

However, many times the meaning of the word will be clearer if it has been asked in a suitable language. simply put, if the original text has the word “Tel Aviv” for example, maybe we can get better results of WSD if we translate the text to Hebrew, then by using the Hebrew language model, and analyzing the probability distribution over different meanings of the query.

Given the fact that there are half a billion native Arabic speakers, in this project I will focus on disambiguation problems related to Arab world: Arab countries, Arabic culture, Arabic foods, Arab news, etc.

 I will compare between the results of WSD by using BERT pre-training model, and between the translated results of the original text and the query to Arabic while using basic language model.
 
The Arabic language model will be trained using a rich dataset from different resources (e.g., Wikipedia, twitter…)
